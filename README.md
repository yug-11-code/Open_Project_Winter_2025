# Open Project – Winter 2025

## Overview
This project consolidates Assignments 1–5 of the course into a single, well-documented
machine learning based research mini-project. The objective is to reconstruct quantum
states using machine learning based quantum state tomography (ML-QST) and analyze
performance using standard evaluation metrics.

## Problem Statement
Quantum State Tomography (QST) aims to reconstruct an unknown quantum state from
measurement outcomes. Traditional QST methods scale poorly with system size. In this
project, we explore machine learning based approaches to improve scalability and efficiency.

## Methodology
- Measurement datasets generated using SIC-POVM / Pauli measurements
- Neural network based reconstruction model
- Training and evaluation implemented in modular Python scripts
- Performance evaluated using Fidelity, Trace Distance, and runtime analysis

## Repository Structure

## Workflow
1. Dataset generation
2. Model training
3. Model evaluation
4. Metric computation
5. Result visualization and analysis

## Results Summary
Detailed quantitative results, plots, and tables are provided in the `results/` directory.

## Final Reflection
Scaling experiments show increasing computational and memory requirements with
system size. Future improvements may include optimized architectures, distributed
training, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches.
